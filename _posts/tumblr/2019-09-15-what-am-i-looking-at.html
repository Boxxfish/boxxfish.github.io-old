<p>Hey, welcome to my dev blog! I’ve been trying to find a way to document the projects I work on, and finally decided to start working on something like this. In the past, I tried using Twitter (failed because I don’t post nearly enough for it to be of real use) and Reddit (have absolutely never done anything productive on it), but decided to ditch them, at least for documentation purposes.</p><p>I’m going to be using this page mainly to post updates on projects I’m working on, and occasionally to post unrelated things like technologies I’m trying to learn. Hopefully, whenever I finish a project, you’ll be able to track my progress from start to finish by looking through the tags. Easy access to that kind of info is real important to me.<br/></p><p>Come to think of it, why are you reading this? I’m literally writing this 10 minutes after hitting the “Create account” button. If I had to guess, you either:</p><ul><li>Are a big fan of me from the future and can’t get enough of my posts (very unlikely)</li><li>Decided to look around and stumbled upon my blog by accident (in which case, hi)<br/></li><li>Or are looking for something to cancel me with, because I somehow have become a public Internet figure (please don’t)</li></ul><p>That wraps up everything I had to say. Stick around! It’ll be worth it. I hope.<br/></p>
