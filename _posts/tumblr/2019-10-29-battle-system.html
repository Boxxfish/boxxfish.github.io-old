<p>Some bad news. I was planning on spending a bunch of time over the weekend (and this week) working on Colony Caseus, so I release around the time of Halloween. Unfortunately, development’s been kinda slow, and I’ll definitely need some time to get people to test it, so that’s probably out the window. That also means I haven’t done anything major since my last post. Trying to think of something to write about, I remembered that I said in one post that I’d show off my battle system in more depth. So that’s what this post is gonna be about.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="392" data-orig-width="704"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/c93987c7fee004b1efad330ebd52f3b1/622753d6831afd3c-51/s540x810/8259c685baa36eb2cffeca80456dabc478cbcc72.gif" data-orig-height="392" data-orig-width="704"/></figure><p>First of all, our player character has shading again! If you looked at some recent previous posts, I temporarily removed shading from his sprites so I could work on adding new animations in. The other new thing you might have noticed are those blue squares with items on top of them. All key items in game are picked up in interactive sections (what pops up if you go to a yellow tile). For really common items, though, like ammo packs, I wanted players to just walk over to them to pick them up. Couple reasons for that. One, having to click through a point and click section every time you pick up items like that can get really annoying and break immersion. Two, I’d have to create individual interactives for every such item, and I’m not doing that.</p><p>Here’s what picking up an item looks like:<br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="390" data-orig-width="702"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/f097f38939d662200948a1f6d6d09b38/622753d6831afd3c-e8/s540x810/85164c9105d506d9083567420de3a1be84315644.gif" data-orig-height="390" data-orig-width="702"/></figure><p>These items are only useful when there are enemies to fight. So why not fight one?<br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="390" data-orig-width="702"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/16bf5e611492e696236fdc75079d0f24/622753d6831afd3c-71/s540x810/3c6772d47e3a5887f82c516f059a8694bdedfc66.gif" data-orig-height="390" data-orig-width="702"/></figure><p>..yikes, bit of a glitch there with that teleporting hopping. To defeat that enemy, I just have to click on it until its health runs out. Even though it only takes one hit to kill, its small hitbox and fast movement makes it difficult to take down without getting hit at least once. It might even be better to try to outrun it to the next room while its jumping onto the platform. Anyway, during our little battle, I’ve lost a little health and used up one bullet. This is where our items come in. All I have to do is click the new “Use” button on the items menu, and I’m good to go.<br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="386" data-orig-width="704"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/f968f45817e63723e9017baa7de5bb1b/622753d6831afd3c-b8/s540x810/8b78f1e6fe59e410f7846cf64719627b2597382d.gif" data-orig-height="386" data-orig-width="704"/></figure><p>One thing you might worry about after watching that gif is whether you get enough space in your inventory to hold onto both key items and replenishing items. The short answer? You don’t. The scariest and defining feature of survival horror games to me is how much you have to micromanage your supplies. Yes, the game lets you shoot enemies and heal yourself, but that also means that you have a responsibility to be prepared at all times. Run out of ammo and walk into a room full of enemies? Well, you could have stocked up on ammo packs before exploring this section, so it’s not the game’s fault. Even now, the tensest parts of survival horror games aren’t the sections where a monster suddenly jump scares you or an unbeatable enemy constantly stalks you. It’s the sections where you’re about to die, you’ve spent all your ammo, and you’re too far away from a save point to preserve your progress. If you aren’t careful, any moment could mean having to replay your last thirty minutes all over again. That feeling is precisely what I want to capture in this game.<br/></p>
