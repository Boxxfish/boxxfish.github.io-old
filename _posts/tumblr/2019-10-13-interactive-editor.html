<p>It’s October break, so I’ve been splitting my free time between working on Colony Caseus and playing Resident Evil 7. Great game, I feel like Capcom really redeemed themselves after RE6. While it didn’t really involve the main storyline or cast, I loved the puzzles, item collecting, and atmosphere that made RE 1 - 4 so good. Once RE2make goes on sale, I’ll definitely be getting it.</p><p>But enough about my love of Resident Evil. I’m writing this to talk about <i>my</i> survival horror game. Last week, I covered my enemy editor, which lets me easily create bosses and enemies. This week, I want to talk about my interactive editor. In Colony Caseus, interactives are the point-and-click sections that pop up when you examine a yellow tile. Here’s an in game example:</p><figure data-orig-width="702" data-orig-height="394" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/0f84850dabae8ffaa28a95bd2d911532/cc397ad6961c4ef3-2e/s540x810/44920a69f227c729ee90ac2913e9ec2b7f87a080.gif" alt="image" data-orig-width="702" data-orig-height="394"/></figure><p>Once an interactive pops up, you can interact with them to solve puzzles and pick up items. Since there are so many of these throughout the game, and players are gonna spend lots of time solving them, I needed a way to make interactive creation as quick, painless, and polished as possible. That’s where my interactive editor comes in.</p><figure data-orig-width="789" data-orig-height="480" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/af36ace53be6fb60438dbdedfb876086/cc397ad6961c4ef3-cd/s540x810/db6c1400521abfd2b153be4dab01a19f6b7dcdd3.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="789" data-orig-height="480"/></figure><p>When you first open the program up, this is what you’re greeted with. Let’s take a little tour, shall we?</p><figure data-orig-width="834" data-orig-height="550" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/66e910e69543213cb1f5df18104517ef/cc397ad6961c4ef3-b6/s540x810/84f9bd32ecfdd75719851e090988f6da1252a684.gif" alt="image" data-orig-width="834" data-orig-height="550"/></figure><p>The first tab contains the layout editor. Here, I can drag and drop elements into their final positions. As you might have noticed from the GIF, all elements are locked to pixel perfect positions. That way, graphics don’t look slightly off and you get a nice retro feel. The first time I tried to make a game like this, I made everything in the Unity UI editor. It was a pain making sure everything was locked to integer coordinates, and selecting elements didn’t feel very good. I was also afraid the Unity renderer would mess up and have some pixels “bleed” into neighborhooding ones (although Unity’s improved its 2D tools since then). With this editor, I’ve tried my best to get rid of those minor but efficiency killing issues.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="906" data-orig-height="522" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/65a82c7e1fed45de46f5dc4e181dba10/cc397ad6961c4ef3-49/s540x810/833a2eb1cd04b192b6caf6a07f6259ce750d5e96.gif" alt="image" data-orig-width="906" data-orig-height="522"/></figure><p>Next is the sprite editor. Another issue I had with working with my Unity prototype was how creating a sprite atlas was done. I’d create my spritesheet, import it into my project, split it into the sprites I needed, create a separate gameobject for each one, then manipulate them as needed. For interactives that had lots of elements, this meant that not only did I need to spend time splitting up the sprites, I also had to spend time making a separate gameobject for each one as well. With this editor, I decided to make element sprite creation and element object creation one step. By selecting the element I want and dragging a border over it, I can quickly go from spritesheet to interactive elements in a matter of seconds. This is especially useful when I go back and edit the spritesheet, as it takes much less time to redraw sprite boundaries.</p><p>(I decided not to implement the clickmask editor when writing the editor, so it does nothing.)</p><p>On the left is my elements list. Not only does it let me drag elements into the interactive, but double clicking also allows me to view the element’s scripts.</p><figure data-orig-width="597" data-orig-height="519" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/991517e62e6251bf3b14f5e0f5b82fa2/cc397ad6961c4ef3-33/s540x810/e757675c9628dfa9501e122c42d0e3638bad8f86.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="597" data-orig-height="519"/></figure><p>There are three important scripts I can plug in. One is OnLoad, which activates when the interactive loads or the element is no longer hidden. For example, I might want to hide a lock if I’ve set “UNLOCKED DOOR” in my save data to true. The second is OnClick, which controls what happens if the element is clicked. Obviously, that’s pretty important. The stuff in OnClick lets players get more info on elements, take items, push buttons, and a whole lot more. Finally is OnItem. This is like OnClick, except it only activates when an item is selected from the inventory. For example, I can have a lock remove a key from the inventory and unlock a door when that key is selected while clicking the lock. Another thing to note: to make interacting with interactives more intuitive, in game, selecting an element with either an OnClick script or an OnItem script causes a selector to appear over it.<br/></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="386" data-orig-width="702"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/e5764a0d58b28331a00d113b35a413b5/cc397ad6961c4ef3-08/s540x810/46f879a20c190f1eb04e05ee4351c968d4b2f4c2.gif" data-orig-height="386" data-orig-width="702"/></figure><p>This little tool took only about a week to make, but has saved me so much time and energy creating the most detailed and important sections of Colony Caseus. No wonder Iwata was able to dig Earthbound out of dev hell with the tools he programmed.<br/></p>
