<p>During my free time, I’ve been working on a game I’m calling Colony Caseus. It’s a retro point and click/isometric survival horror game (a whole bunch of stuff, I know) that takes place on an abandoned space colony. By reading notes left behind and solving puzzles, you have to figure out what happened and escape. Since it is a survival game, you also have to avoid and kill enemies with limited supplies.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="702" data-orig-height="394" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/f2513a603508c0d9c59e5d465d67236c/09916f1bb76f472d-88/s540x810/fd0d8545d65204f81222e022cd8e79dacb9af8cf.gif" data-orig-width="702" data-orig-height="394"/></figure><p>The game combines two of my favorite genres: survival horror and point and click. Both are puzzle heavy and atmospheric, but in survival horror, you solve puzzles by interacting with the world (like pushing boxes to clear a path), while in point and click, you have really detailed puzzle sections with limited ability to navigate the world. I wanted to play a game where I could have sections of deep puzzle solving without sacrificing the ability to fully navigate through the game’s world.<br/></p><figure data-orig-width="704" data-orig-height="390" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/cd6a4f3436b7961bc2b96f9e7df227c3/09916f1bb76f472d-9c/s540x810/bbf452ba898a701ac5bc4e08b78a9a4db69623b3.gif" data-orig-width="704" data-orig-height="390"/></figure><figure data-orig-width="709" data-orig-height="392" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/f8fb9874a786cd60b39cc20a312f7c05/09916f1bb76f472d-99/s540x810/92dc5cb96827b7048387c6e31cf842ea521b6c70.png" data-orig-width="709" data-orig-height="392"/></figure><p>My issue with both genres can be summed up in the following scenario. Let’s say I wanted a room where you walk in, shoot some zombies, then solve a puzzle on a table. In survival horror, it’s possible to have a good combat system to really make that encounter terrifying. You’d have to have some skill to maneuver your character around the enemy and kill it at a time critical moment. In a point and click game, it’s a lot harder to have skill based combat sections, especially if you want to have click-escape style sections later on, but the puzzles are more fun than ones in survival horror games (at least in my opinion). With this game, I’m trying to strike a balance between the two so both point and click sections and action sections feel like one cohesive game world.</p><figure data-orig-width="708" data-orig-height="398" class="tmblr-full"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/e0339b76dd278bdf2cbc7587e8ce29f4/09916f1bb76f472d-8a/s540x810/d075695316f346995a4127211ed73ea0e3e39df0.png" data-orig-width="708" data-orig-height="398"/></figure><p>At the moment, other than some fine tuning and testing, I’ve finished all the interactive portions of the game. Right now, I’m implementing a combat system for enemies and bosses. That involves adding a lot of game mechanics (health items, ammo, aiming, enemy data, etc), and adds a new dimension of play, too. To speed up that process, I’m writing an editor for enemy entities, so it shouldn’t take too long to add enemies into the game once it’s done. After that, I just need some playtesting, and it should be ready for release.</p><p>This actually isn’t my first attempt at a game like this. About two years ago, I put out <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/698116">a game that tried to do the same thing. </a>Unfortunately, it wasn’t very good. Some parts were confusing, there wasn’t a clear storyline, and playing it just didn’t feel good. With this game, I plan on revamping every aspect that sucked in the original, from better combat mechanics to better storytelling. I’m also going do more playtesting, because I kinda sorta skipped that step in the first game. Releasing that game taught me an important lesson: never release something unless you’re proud to put your name on it.</p><p>That’s it for now. Tune in next week when I (hopefully) finish the game!<br/></p>
