 to Cornell weekend for Big Red Hacks. I’ve gone to two hackathons so far: one as a high school student, and a 6 hour one as part of college orientation. The nice thing about this one was instead of the usual 24 hour time limit, you had 36 hours. Those 12 hours made a HUGE difference; my team had time to start thinking about an idea and sleep over it for a couple hours before committing to anything. I also felt less stressed about how fast I had to work, even though my team didn’t end up quite finishing. But who’s ever really finished a project during an event like this?</p><p>We initially were going with the idea of coordinating robots to fight wildfires, but we ran into a couple issues about an hour in. One, there are companies with more time and resources that were working on that very issue. Two, based on our research, forest fires are largely caused by human oversight, from campers recklessly throwing lit cigarettes away to government officials allowing people to build dangerously far into the woods. The second issue inspired our next idea: Will It Pass, a web app that uses machine learning to see how dedicated our representatives are to certain issues. There are people in Congress who we assume have certain positions because of their party, but when it comes down to it, have voted against issues that matter to us. Basically, this was the goal of Will It Pass:</p><ol><li>Use bill vote data to train neural network models, so the models could predict how likely a lawmaker would be to pass a bill containing given keywords.</li><li>Have the user provide keywords associated with issues they care about.</li><li>Based on the keywords given, have the models predict the chance each person in Congress would say “Yes” to the bill.</li></ol><div><p>The idea was, if you typed in something like “environmental regulation“ and found out that the people representing you were only 60% likely to pass bills for it, you could do some research into why and confront them at a town hall or something.</p><p>We had three people working on three distinct components of our final product. One person was working on creating the models in Tensorflow. From what I could tell, he was mapping words present in bills to integers, then yeeting those integers into our models as inputs. For output comparisons, he used the voting decisions of different politicians to associate words with pass rate. I’m new to data science, so seeing a real life example of it really fascinated me. I also got to saw the workflow data scientists use. Our AI guy was using Jupyter Notebook to run and test our models, so once he got everything working, he just had to put everything into one cell for the rest of the team to use.</p><p>Another person worked on the actual web app. One of the sponsors was Google, so we tried to get App Engine to work with our Flask app. To his credit, everything was fine until he uploaded a version that used Tensorflow to load our models about three hours before we had to submit. That instantly broke everything, even though things were working locally. I guess it was because the server had to install Tensorflow and its dependencies, but wow, was it a big shame. We couldn’t even upload code to the thing. For what it was worth, if it wasn’t for the Tensorflow integration, we would have totally finished everything. You can see above his interface, which let you type in keywords to predict the chance of bills passing and select states to view senators.</p><p>My job was to get the data nice and pretty for our models. Unfortunately, this was way harder than I thought it would be. We used the ProPublica Congressional API to gather data, but there were a few caveats. One, there was a limit of 5,000 requests per day, so we couldn’t just constantly query the server on the info we needed. Two, they didn’t just give you all the info we needed in one nice JSON file. First, you had to know which bills you wanted and their ID’s, which took an API call. Then, you had to get the roll call vote status of each bill, and save the yea/nay value for all the people who voted. Then, all that info had to be compiled into a csv file for our models to read. I actually had to do some more research in how bills get voted on to make sense of some of the process. I didn’t realize there were cases where you could get bills to pass without a roll call vote, for instance, by using a vocal vote instead where everyone just calls out their vote and people guess how many people said yes. I had to check if a bill was passed and voted on for it to make it into the set. This might sound obvious, but I also didn’t realize how mundane a lot of the bills are. Some of the bills just cover day to day government functions, without any political meaning. We used Google Natural Language to extract keywords from the bills, and while it was easy to figure out what the exciting ones were about based on the keywords, the blander ones were a bit&hellip; ambiguous. Despite initial difficulties, I managed to get the data working with our models, and we ended up with models representing the decisions of 20 senators.</p><p>We didn’t win anything, but I still had a ton of fun at Big Red Hacks. I got along well with my teammates, who I had just met there, and I learned a lot, too. This was my first time working with Google AI (and AI in general for a project), and I was really surprised how easy it was to integrate. This was also my first time gathering data and preparing it for AI, as in the past, I just used ready made datasets. That skill should come in handy if I start using AI in the real world. Last but not least, I learned a thing or two on how our democracy functions, and all I’m gonna say is for the majority of us, we know way less about the people in power than we think we do.<br/></p></div>
