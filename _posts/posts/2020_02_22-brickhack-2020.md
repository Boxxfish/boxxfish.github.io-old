First post of 2020! Which is kind of a disappointment, actually, because I was trying to push out a new post every week. I took some time off for vacation, but then I got real busy after the new semester started, so I delayed posting to the blog. But I'm here now, and will be in the near future.

Also, between the last post and this one, I migrated to Jekyll. Helloooo, markdown!

## Brickhack

Two weeks ago was Brickhack, my school's big hackathon. I was really excited to go, since I heard great stuff from everyone who went last year (great food, sponsors, prizes). It didn't disappoint except for the fact that there was almost no free coffee available. They had a lot of Monster, but I stay away from energy drinks.

This hackathon was a really unconventional one for me. I was planning on bringing someone with me, but they didn't make it in, so I had to find another teammate. I thought I found one ten minutes in, but then they had to leave. Finally, I joined another team to work on their project, which I thought was pretty cool. Well, the project relied heavily on one of the sponsors' API's, and it turned out that the API was missing lots of information. We had to scrap that, so we went with a VR project. Unfortunately, the VR headset had issues connecting with out hardware, so we had to scrap that project too. At that point, I peaced out to work on a project solo.

The nice thing about doing a hackathon on home turf is you don't have to stay in the venue if you don't want to. I took a short walk to my dorm, where I could work in peace and have all the coffee I needed. I had around ten hours at this point to come up with something, so I decided to work on a project that I had been thinking about for a while: a cloud based web asset baking and generating tool. I ended up calling it AssetPipe. If you read some of my other posts, you know I'm into game development. And by game development, I mean the whole process, from scripting the mechanics to writing the asset creation tools. As an indie developer, one of the annoying things I have to deal with is having assets tightly coupled to the engine I'm using. Unity users will have heard the phrase "the Unity way", which refers to developing your game in a way that most of your work is done inside the Unity Editor. For custom assets that need specialized tools, you should write an editor for those tools inside the Unity Editor. Dealing with that mindset was a real pain at times. AssetPipe was conceived to free assets from the engine.

Essentially, this is what I wanted to do with the app:
..1. Use whatever asset repository I want. By asset repository, I mean both prebaked assets (files that contain info the editor needs) and baked assets(filed optimized for the engine, usually in binary). I use Google Drive to hold onto my assets, but Github should work, too.
..2. Quickly set up pipelines for whatever assets I need. Let's say I want to create a new type of asset that defines different weapons the player can pick up. The prebaked asset file could have info the weapon editor tool needs, like editing history, that the baked file should discard. Then, I want to take the remaining fields and convert them into my engine specific format. Normally, I would have to write a new Python script every time I want to define a process like this. With the tool, using a node based editor, I would just need to drag components around and chain them together to build a flexible baking system.
..3. Automate as much of the process as I can. Back to the example above, every time I make a change to the prebaked asset repo without cloud baking, I need to run the asset processing script again to see changes in the game. With AssetPipe, as soon as it detects a change in the repo, it should re-bake the changed assets. As a bonus, this should cut down on time spent baking assets, because right now, if I change an asset and run the baking script, all assets in the folder get re-baked. This is a problem if an asset type requires lots of processing and there are over 100 of them in the folder.
..4. As a stretch goal, use machine learning to not just bake assets, but generate them as well. I've been studying up on AI recently, and there's a lot of potential for it to cut down on the asset creation process. For instance, given key frames of a character animation, AssetPipe could fill in the in-between frames as well.

There was a lot of things I wanted to do, and not a whole lot of time, so I set up a Trello board. If I could finish one task an hour, I would have something substantial enough to be judged.

My first task was to set up a Flask backend with a React frontend. Flask is a Python framework, and React relies on NodeJS for a lot of its functionality, so I wasn't sure how much trouble it would give me. Fortunately, I just had to compile React into a static web app, then use Flask to serve the app.

Next, I set up the database. I decided to use MongoDB Atlas as a cloud based NoSQL service, and I'm glad I did, since it turned out to be the least hassle I've ever had with setting up a database. I filled in my test entry, which contained the user's credentials and the data they would need to use the web app.

After that, I started working on the front end. I wanted an admin console style program, where after logging in, users could click different tabs on the sidebar to monitor different resources. I had three main tabs:

Overview, for an overview of the user's projects and components,

![Projects](/assets/2_22_20/2.png)

projects, for controlling project settings and asset definitions per project

![Components](/assets/2_22_20/4.png)

and components, for creating components that could be used from project to project.

Inside the project work area, users could edit their prebaked and baked asset sources, and change how assets for that project were processed. All projects would contain a master "game" asset that would dictate how all the assets should be re-baked.

Finally, I started working on the node editor. I say "finally", because it turned out to be the last substantial thing I did. I was planning on just using a React component someone else had built, but out of the 5 packages I vetted, only one worked with my app. By the time I integrated something basic into AssetPipe, time was up.

Here's what I ended up with:

I didn't finish, but I had a lot of fun working on a passion project. I'll definitely pick up the project again soon, if not for public release, at least to make my life easier when dealing with assets.
